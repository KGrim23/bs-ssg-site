We learnt about bootstrap framework and advantages of it.

-Bootstraps Course work:

1. Pick a topic/subject close to your heart, or a business local to you.
2. We're going to design a website based on that topic.
3. Added my own CSS, but the main bulk of the work should be done using Bootstrap.

Bootstrap components:

-Carousel Hero section
-Accordion for info
-Cards for skills section
-Use a contact form
